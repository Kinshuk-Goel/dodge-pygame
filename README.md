# dodge-pygame

This is the `releases` branch. This is where I released both **beta** and **official** versions of the game.

Download the **first version** of the game => [Game_Release1](https://github.com/Kinshuk-Goel/dodge-pygame/raw/releases/Game_Release1%20(exe))

Checkout the `changelog.md` to keep track on changes that were made. Also, checkout the other two branches, `main` and `experimental`

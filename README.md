Prevent object from crashing into an obsticle. Very basic, 2D game programmed in Python. Also, it's not that fun lol!

This is the `releases` branch. This is where I released both **beta** and **official** versions of the game.

Checkout the `changelog.md` to keep track on changes that were made. Also, checkout the other two branches, `main` and `experimental`

`:D`

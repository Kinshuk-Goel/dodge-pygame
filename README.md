This is the `releases` branch. This is where I released both **beta** and **official** versions of the game.

.exe version not working on native Windows machine. You can run it on Linux through Wine, or you can run the python file.

Checkout the `changelog.md` to keep track on changes that were made. Also, checkout the other two branches, `main` and `experimental`

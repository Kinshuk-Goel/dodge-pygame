# ChangeLog of the game script

*April-20-2021:*
        Beta Release 1:
                - Basic elements of a game, a character and an enemy.

                - There's like enemies **FLYING** through the game.

                - Once the charater (cyan-color) gets in contact with the enemy (so flying white rectangles) then the game will auto-quit.

                - Also I get a bunch of school work and I'm like 1/4 lazy, so releases may come like once a month.

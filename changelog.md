# ChangeLog of the game script

*Feb-14-2021:*
        What changed:
                - Improved **A LOT** of the game. The fist commit made on the GitHub project didn't even relate to the goal of this project at all. 

                - Created a "surface" character. Background is black. The charcter can be moved with arrow keys. 

                - --The character was going off of screen-- [`FIXED`]

                - Created a changelog document. This is where changes will be documented, since the commits have the same message, and may not provide as much useful information.

        What changed:
                - `Minor changes`

                - Made the color of the character 'aqua' -- but its probably going to be changed soon

                - Created an `experimental_code` script, this is for experimenting with other code that can be added.

                - The character can now be controlled with both *wasd* and *arrow* keys! (Also it's like mixed, so you can use *W* to move up and *down_arrow_key* to move down at the same time.)

                - Also the fact that vscode is showing me 9+ errors although the code is working lol. I'll try to find a way to dismiss those errors, but may not be so relevant because those errors don't show up on GitHub.

        What changed:
                - `Yes, it's been a long time, plus I actually did something useful in the game`

                - Created multiple events
                - Created multiple enemies

                - So basically the "core" of the game is created, **the main character tries to avoid touching the bad-guys**

                - However, today was only a core-creation. So if the player was to interact with the enemies, nothing would happen because I haven't coded that just yet. 

*April-20-2021:*
        What changed:
                - **First version released!** You can download it from the link provided in the `main` branch. Alternatively, you can download this section and run the exe file located here.

                - macOS and Linux versions coming soon very quickly. I just haven't gotten time to extract them into a file that can be runned.

                - Functional game. The charcter (cyan) avoids the enemies (flying white rectangles) on a pink background.

                - The python file is located in the `resources` branch, the `main_project.py` file in this branch doesn't have the latest updates; it's a little bit outdated.
